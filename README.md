A logistics company needs to optimise their delivery routes.
They are based in Durban and deliver to between 4 and 20 locations in KwaZulu-Natal per day.
They have a single vehicle.

## My Task

Write a Python or R script to find the optimal (minimum time) route between these six locations:

1. 115 St Andrew's Drive, Durban North, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  
2. 67 Boshoff Street, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  
3. 4 Paul Avenue, Fairview, Empangeni, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  
4. 166 Kerk Street, Vryheid, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  
5. 9 Margaret Street, Ixopo, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa 
6. 16 Poort Road, Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
